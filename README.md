This repository is focused on making a chess AI. I plan to research a couple different modern methods for implementing a chess AI and then compare them. 

I am using Disservin chess-library to handle all of the base game logic. Here is the link --> https://github.com/Disservin/chess-library

Feel free to add to it if you want!
